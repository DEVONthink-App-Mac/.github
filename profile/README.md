## What is DEVONthink Pro for Mac?

DEVONthink Pro for Mac is a **sophisticated document management and knowledge base system** designed specifically for macOS. It helps users store, organize, and retrieve vast amounts of information—from PDFs and notes to images and web archives—using artificial intelligence and smart categorization.

The software offers three core editions:  
- **DEVONthink Personal** – for individual users.  
- **DEVONthink Pro** – for advanced data management.  
- **DEVONthink Server** – for team collaboration.  

DEVONthink Pro uses AI to suggest related documents, auto-classify content, and even summarize text. It supports encryption, scripting, and synchronization across multiple devices, making it ideal for researchers, writers, lawyers, and anyone dealing with large volumes of information.

Fully optimized for **macOS Sonoma, Ventura, and Monterey**, DEVONthink runs seamlessly on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3). It integrates with macOS features like Spotlight, Quick Look, and Share Extensions.

Whether you're archiving research, managing project files, or building a personal knowledge library, DEVONthink Pro offers the tools to keep everything accessible and organized.
